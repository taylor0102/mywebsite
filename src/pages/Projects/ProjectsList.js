Enterprises, mid-market businesses, startups, and entrepreneurs value our agile process because it yields working software quickly, and then allows us to iterate. Most software development companies take a project-based approach. This naturally puts them on a waterfall methodology. Waterfall isn't the best way to build software, though. When your business depends on your mobile app or custom software, choose a development partner who will build the right way. Established businesses also benefit from our agile workflows. They lean on Designli when launching new, software-driven initiatives for many of these same reasons, seeking internal buy-in while iterating quickly based on customer feedback.
